      <description>If you want something done right, automate it.
Modern Open-Source Maintenance As the maintainer of sse-starlette, my GitHub notifications rarely bring me joy on a lazy Saturday afternoon.
This weekend, I decided to push Claude Code a little bit, hoping to save precious summer time.
Issue #140 didn&amp;rsquo;t just look interesting; it appeared non-trivial, touching on asyncio intricacies, multi-threading, and event-loop handling—elements that typically guarantee headaches.
Rather than my usual deep-dive session of debugging and refactoring, I handed the reins to Claude Code, eager to see if it could manage the problem.</description>

      <description>Fast, Reliable, Yours: Why Snippets Outshine LLMs for boring Tasks While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are revolutionizing workflows with their smart completions and contextual insights, you don’t want to re-research a command or script every time you need it.
Why does a good snippet manager still matter? Even in an age of intelligent assistants, there’s a compelling case for a specialized and fast snippet manager:
Speed: LLMs are slow when it comes to re-fetching familiar snippets.</description>
