      <description>Given multiple sets of data points. Select one point per set so that the distances between the points is minimal.1
Model Non-convex MIQP Model $$ \min \sum_{i,j| ok_{i,j}} dist_{i,j} \cdot x_i \cdot x_j \\ \sum_{i|group_{i,g}} x_i = 1 \forall g \\ x_i \in {0,1} $$
Linear MIP Model To linearize the model a standard procedure can be applied:
Let&amp;rsquo;s introduce a new binary variable, $z_{i,j}$, that represents the product of the binary variables $\color{darkred}x_i$ and $\color{darkred}x_j$.</description>

      <description>Double-click-&amp;gt;Open. But for VIM. No mouse.
Key Features Open URIs, html, docx, pptx, jpg, png, mp3, &amp;hellip; Handle almost any URI Paste URLs with human-friendly description vimania-uri
Why? One magic power of OS UI is the capability of opening URIs by just double-clicking. As CLI worker using a mouse does not cut it.
Markdown Plugin To deal with markdown a plugin is helpful, e.g. plasticboy&amp;rsquo;s plugin.
It allows to create new files by adding a link [topic](topic) and then jump to it by typing ge while the cursor is on the link.</description>

      <description>A refresher in software architecture philosophies with Perseverance, Patience and Python.
This is a high-speed overflight over current approaches with an occasional deep dive.
CRUD, MVC simple concepts and therefore effective communication in dev teams works as expected. Limits known, e.g. modelling complex business domains DDD and Clean Architecture structure of software logic reflects business processes ubiquitous language as common communication ground for developer and business concepts like Aggregate and UnitOfWork provide clear consistency and concurrency model.</description>

      <description>Using code snippets cross platform in VIM and JetBrains IDE without having to maintain them twice!
As developer we are always striving to improve our (work)flow.
This includes especially tooling, of course.
Here omes taste, capability, technology and craze come together in an unholy mélange of preferences. Your idea of Nirvana surely will be different from mine.
I am using two IDEs:
vim JetBrains PyCharm A challenge while coding is to remember correct syntax, so IDEs provide helpers like code completion, linters and yes, still code snippets (call me old-fashioned).</description>

      <title>Job Shop Scheduling Problem</title>

      <description>The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is an NP-hard problem. 1
The JSSP is defined by a set of jobs that must be executed by a set of machines in a specific order for each job. Each job has a defined execution time for each machine and a defined processing order of machines. Also, each job must use each machine only once. The machines can only execute a job at a time and once started, the machine cannot be interrupted until the completion of the assigned job.</description>

      <description>Find 10 points out of 50 with maximum distance from each other.1
This problem can modelled as a max-min model where we maximize the smallest distance of 10 points.
Model $$ \max \Delta\\ s.t.\\ \Delta \le d_{i,j} + M(1- x_i x_j), \forall i \lt j \\ \sum_i x_i = k\\ x_i \in {0,1}\\ $$
M is an upper bound on the distances: $$ M = \max_{i\le j} d_{i,j}\\ $$</description>
