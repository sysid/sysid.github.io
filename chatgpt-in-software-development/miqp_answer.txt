To linearize the given model, we need to remove the quadratic terms in the objective function. The quadratic term in the objective function is $x_i \cdot x_j$. We can introduce a new binary variable $y_{i,j}$ to replace this term, which represents the product of $x_i$ and $x_j$. The new variable $y_{i,j}$ will take the value 1 if both $x_i$ and $x_j$ are 1, and 0 otherwise.

The linearized model will be:

\begin{align*}
    & \min \sum_{i,j| ok_{i,j}} dist_{i,j} \cdot y_{i,j} \\
    & \sum_{i|group_{i,g}} x_i = 1 \quad \forall g \\
    & y_{i,j} \ge x_i + x_j - 1 \quad \forall i,j | ok_{i,j} \\
    & y_{i,j} \le x_i \quad \forall i,j | ok_{i,j} \\
    & y_{i,j} \le x_j \quad \forall i,j | ok_{i,j} \\
    & x_i \in \{0,1\} \\
    & y_{i,j} \in \{0,1\}
\end{align*}

The new constraints ensure that $y_{i,j}$ takes the value of the product of $x_i$ and $x_j$. Specifically, the first two constraints enforce that $y_{i,j}$ must be 0 if either $x_i$ or $x_j$ is 0, while the third constraint guarantees that $y_{i,j}$ must be 1 if both $x_i$ and $x_j$ are 1.
