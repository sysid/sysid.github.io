This is a primer on Mixed Integer Programming.
It builds on [Part2](../mip_for_dummies)

It is based on personal learning experience and focuses on application rather than theory.
For a rigorous approach please refer to a textbook.

## Connect decision variable with boolean variable
From [Part2](../mip_for_dummies) it is known that the fundamental technique to link continuous decision variables with
indicator/boolean variables is via Big-M/Small-m constraints.

They implement the following logical statement:
$$
\delta = 1 \Leftrightarrow x \gt 0 \tag{0}
$$

To allow for more complex boolean logic in MIP models this fundamental relationship needs to be generalized:

## Indicator for inequality
One of the simplest logical question that can be asked in mathematical programming is whether a given
choice of the decision variables satisfies a constraint. More precisely, *when* is the following constraint
satisfied?
$$
f(x_1, ... , x_n) \le b\\
\Leftrightarrow\\
\sum_j a_jx_j \le b
$$

Let $M, m$ be an upper and lower bound:
$$
\sum_j a_jx_j -b \le M\\
\sum_j a_jx_j -b \ge m\\
$$

#### <a name='le' /> Indicator for $\le$
$$
\bold{\delta = 1 \Leftrightarrow \sum_j a_jx_j \le b} \tag{1}
$$

##### Linearization
$$
\tag{1a} \Rightarrow: \ \sum_j a_jx_j +M\delta \le M + b
$$

$$
\tag{1b} \Leftarrow: \ \sum_j a_jx_j - (m -\epsilon)\delta \ge b + \epsilon
$$

If $a_j, x_j \in N$ we can set $\epsilon = 1$.

#### <a name='ge' /> Indicator for $\ge$
$$
\bold{\delta = 1 \Leftrightarrow \sum_j a_jx_j \ge b} \tag{2}
$$

##### Linearization
$$
\tag{2a} \Rightarrow: \ \sum_j a_jx_j + m\delta \ge m + b
$$
$$
\tag{2b} \Leftarrow: \ \sum_j a_jx_j - (M + \epsilon)\delta \le b - \epsilon
$$

## <a name='eq' /> Indicator for equality
#### Indicator for $=$
$$
\bold{\delta = 1 \rightarrow \sum_j a_jx_j = b} \tag{3a}
$$

##### Resulting constraints
Use $\delta=1$ to indicate that the $\le$ and $\ge$ cases hold simultaneously.
This is done by stating both the constraints (1a) and (2a) together.
$$
\tag{1a} \sum_j a_jx_j + M\delta \le M + b
$$
$$
\tag{2a} \sum_j a_jx_j + m\delta \ge m + b
$$

#### Indicator for $\ne$
$$
\bold{\delta = 0 \implies \sum_j a_jx_j \ne b} \tag{3b}
$$

If indicator $\delta=0$ we want to force *either* $\le$ or $\ge$ to be broken.
This can be done be introducing $\delta^{'}$ and $\delta^{''}$ in order to link
equation 1b and 2b accordingly.


##### Resulting constraints
$$
\tag{1b} \sum_j a_jx_j - (m -\epsilon)\delta^{'} \ge b + \epsilon
$$
$$
\tag{2b} \sum_j a_jx_j - (M + \epsilon)\delta^{''} \le b - \epsilon
$$

$$
\delta^{'} + \delta^{''} - \delta \le 1 \tag{3c}
$$

(3c) enforces that one of the inequality constraints will be broken if $\delta=0$.


## Logic Primer
Boolean operations are the building blocks for modelling logic in MIP models. Here are some important
relationships.

A proposition is a statement proposing an idea that can be true or false.

Converse of a logical statement/proposition:
$$
p \rightarrow q \equiv \lnot q \rightarrow \lnot p \\
$$

#### Logical Operators (Connectives)
$$
\lor \ \text{inclusive or}\\
\land \ \text{logical and}\\
\lnot \ \text{logical not}\\
\rightarrow \ \text{implies}\\
\Leftrightarrow \ \text{if and only if}\\
$$

#### Example
Proposition P: 'I will miss the bus'
Proposition Q: 'I will be late'
$P \rightarrow Q$ stands for the proposition: If I miss the bus I will be late.

##  Boolean Logic with LP
The trick is to express boolean expressions with LP inequalities.
Let $X_i$  stand for the proposition $\delta_i = 1$, where $\delta$ is an indicator variable.

### Mapping propositions to (0,1) constraints
The following propositions and constraints are equivalent:

$$
X_1 \lor X_2 \Leftrightarrow \delta_1 + \delta_2 \ge 1 \\
X_1 \cdot X_2 \Leftrightarrow \delta_1 = 1, \delta_2 = 1 \\
\lnot X_1 \Leftrightarrow \delta_1 = 0, 1- \delta_1 = 1 \\
X_1 \rightarrow X_2 \Leftrightarrow \delta_1 - \delta_2 \le 0 \\
X_1 \Leftrightarrow X_2 \Leftrightarrow \delta_1 - \delta_2 = 0 \\
$$

### Linearize polynomial boolean relationship
A product term such as $\delta_1\delta_2$ can be linearized:

1. Replace $\delta_1\delta_2$ with $\delta_3$
1. Impose logical condition:
$$\delta_3 \Leftrightarrow \delta_1 \land \delta_2$$
with constraints:
$$
-\delta_1 + \delta_3 \le 0\\
-\delta_2 + \delta_3 \le 0\\
\delta_1 + \delta_2 - \delta_3 \le 1
$$

### Linearize polynomial mixed relationship
A product such as $x\delta$ can be linearized. Here $x$ is a continuous decision variable and $\delta \in {0,1}$.

1. Replace $x\delta$ with $y \in \mathbb{R}$
1. Impose $\delta=1 \Leftrightarrow y=x$
with constraints:
$$
y - M\delta \le 0\\
-x+y \le 0\\
x - y \le M(1-\delta)\\
$$
M is an upper bound for x and hence also y.

## Disjunctive Constraints
Let's have a set of constraints $R_s, s \in [0,..,S]$, where every constraint $R_s$ has the form:
$$
\sum_i a_ix_i \le b \ \text{ or }\ge, =
$$

Disjunction: Only a subset of all constraints needs to hold.
$$
R_1 \lor .. \lor R_N
$$

$R_s$ is the proposition: 'The constraints in subset $s$ are satisfied':

Now introduce an indicator variable $\delta_i$ to indicate whether $R_i$ is satisfied.
Equivalent to the proposition is imposing the logical condition:
$$
\delta_i = 1 \rightarrow R_i\\
$$

This proposition translates into the known set of constraints:

1. [[1]](#le) for $\le$
1. [[2]](#ge) for $\ge$
1. [[3]](#eq) for =

Additionally the disjunction needs to be enforced by the following constraint:
$$
\delta_0 +..+ \delta_S \ge 1
$$

#### Generalization
At least $k$ of $(R_0,..,R_s)$ must be satisfied:
$$
\delta_0 +..+ \delta_S \ge k
$$
At most $k$ of $(R_0,..,R_s)$ must be satisfied:
$$
\delta_0 +..+ \delta_S \le k
$$

## Summary
Disjunctions of constraints involve **$\lor$** and necessitate IP models.
**$\land$** simply involves constraints holding simultaneously.

In this sense, $\land$ corresponds to LP, whereas $\lor$ to IP.

This was a lot of math. Now the foundations are laid.
