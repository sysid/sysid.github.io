When the gradient is very small, this necessarily slows the gradient descent process down; this is of course what we desire when approaching a minima, but is detrimental otherwise. Momentum is intended to help speed the optimisation process through cases like this, to avoid getting stuck in these \u201cshallow valleys\u201d."),Object(i.b)("p",null,"Momentum works by adding a new term to the update function, in addition to the gradient term. The added term can be thought of as the average of the previous gradients. Thus if the previous gradients were zig zagging through a saddle point, their average will be along the valley of the saddle point. Therefore, when we update our weights, we first move opposite the gradient. Then, we also move in the direction of the average of our last few gradients.

Therefore, if the l2-norm is large, the learning rate will be small; if it is small, the learning rate will be large."),Object(i.b)("p",null,"Conceptually, this is a good idea. We know that typically, we want to our step sizes to be small when approaching minima. When they\u2019re too large, we run the risk of bouncing out of minima. However there is no way for us to easily tell when we\u2019re in a possible minima or not, so it\u2019s difficult to recognize this situation and adjust accordingly. Adagrad attempts to do this by operating under the assumption that the larger the distance a parameter has traveled through optimization, the more likely it is to be near a minima; therefore, as the parameter covers larger distances, let\u2019s decrease that parameter\u2019s learning rate to make it more sensitive.
