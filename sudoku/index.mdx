[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)

> a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle.

Fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids 
that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. 

The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

## Challenges

1. Understand the problem (easy)
1. Design the index sets (medium)
1. Translate the model into Pyomo (easy)

## Tooling
- [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) as LP modelling language
- Optimizer: [CBC](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc)
- Python

# Model

## Indexing Schema
![sudoku](sudoku.png)

## Variables
$$
y^m_{i,j;k} =
\begin{cases}
1, \ \text{ when cell $(i,j;k)$ contains number $m$ }\\
0, \ \text{ else }\\
\end{cases}
$$

Example: If 7 appears in $(2,1;1)$, then $y^7_{2,1;1} = 1$

## Row Constraints
$$
\sum_{k=1}^3\sum_{j=1}^3 y_{i,j;k}^m, (i=1,2,3, m=1,..,9)\\
$$

$$
\sum_{k=4}^6\sum_{j=1}^3 y_{i,j;k}^m, (i=1,2,3, m=1,..,9)\\
$$

$$
\sum_{k=7}^9\sum_{j=1}^3 y_{i,j;k}^m, (i=1,2,3, m=1,..,9)\\
$$

## Column Constraints
$$
\sum_{k \in \{1,4,7\}} \sum_{i=1}^3 y_{i,j;k}^m = 1, (j=1,2,3, m=1,..,9)\\
$$

$$
\sum_{k \in \{2,5,8\}} \sum_{i=1}^3 y_{i,j;k}^m = 1, (j=1,2,3, m=1,..,9)\\
$$

$$
\sum_{k \in \{3,6,9\}} \sum_{i=1}^3 y_{i,j;k}^m = 1, (j=1,2,3, m=1,..,9)\\
$$

## Sub-Table Constraint
Subtable contains every number $m$ once:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 y_{i,j;k}^m = 1, (k,m=1,..,9)\\
$$

## Completeness Constraint
Each cell has a number in it:
$$
\sum_{m=1}^9 y_{i,j;k}^m = 1, (k=1,..,9 \ i,j=1,2,3)\\
$$

## Objective
This is not a maximization problem. Only solution feasibility is relevant, so we assume a constant objective.

## Pyomo Implementation
The implementation in Pyomo is straightfoward:
```python
# Row Constraint
model.row_c_1_3 = Constraint(model.I, model.M, rule=lambda model, i, m: sum(
    sum(model.y[i, j, k, m] for j in model.J) for k in model.K if k <= 3) == 1)

model.row_c_4_6 = Constraint(model.I, model.M, rule=lambda model, i, m: sum(
    sum(model.y[i, j, k, m] for j in model.J) for k in model.K if 4 <= k <= 6) == 1)

model.row_c_7_9 = Constraint(model.I, model.M, rule=lambda model, i, m: sum(
    sum(model.y[i, j, k, m] for j in model.J) for k in model.K if 7 <= k) == 1)

# Row Constraint
model.col_147_c = Constraint(model.J, model.M, rule=lambda model, j, m: sum(
    sum(model.y[i, j, k, m] for i in model.I) for k in model.K if k in (1, 4, 7)) == 1)

model.col_258_c = Constraint(model.J, model.M, rule=lambda model, j, m: sum(
    sum(model.y[i, j, k, m] for i in model.I) for k in model.K if k in (2, 5, 8)) == 1)

model.col_369_c = Constraint(model.J, model.M, rule=lambda model, j, m: sum(
    sum(model.y[i, j, k, m] for i in model.I) for k in model.K if k in (3, 6, 9)) == 1)

# Sub-Table constraint
model.subtable_c = Constraint(model.K, model.M, rule=lambda model, k, m: sum(
    sum(model.y[i, j, k, m] for i in model.I) for j in model.J) == 1)

# One number per cell constraint
model.number_c = Constraint(
    model.I, model.J, model.K, rule=lambda model, i, j, k: sum(model.y[i, j, k, m] for m in model.M) == 1
)
```

# Result
Here our the input, a fairly difficult Sudoku for humans:

![challenge](challenge.png)

It takes less than a second to solve for MIP solver CBC:
```
---------------------------------
[ 1  2  6 ][ 4  3  7 ][ 9  5  8 ]
[ 8  9  5 ][ 6  2  1 ][ 4  7  3 ]
[ 3  7  4 ][ 9  8  5 ][ 1  2  6 ]
---------------------------------
[ 4  5  7 ][ 1  9  3 ][ 8  6  2 ]
[ 9  8  3 ][ 2  4  6 ][ 5  1  7 ]
[ 6  1  2 ][ 5  7  8 ][ 3  9  4 ]
---------------------------------
[ 2  6  9 ][ 3  1  4 ][ 7  8  5 ]
[ 5  4  8 ][ 7  6  9 ][ 2  3  1 ]
[ 7  3  1 ][ 8  5  2 ][ 6  4  9 ]
---------------------------------
```

# Summary
The challenge here was to devise a suitable indexing schema in order to formulate the model constraints. Apart from that
everything is straightforward, especially model implementation is very convenient with Pyomo.
