> Like to double-click links in order to "open" them? Here is the keyboard-based VIM version.

#### [vimania-uri][]

## Key Features
1. Open arbitrary URIs in text files, html, docx, pptx, jpg, png, mp3, ...
2. Save URI seamless in bookmark manager [twbm](https://github.com/sysid/twbm) for seamless CLI management
3. Handles almost any kind of URI
4. Paste URLs with human-friendly description


## Why?
One magic power of an OS UI is the capability of opening most URIs by just double-clicking them.
As a CLI worker using the mouse does not cut it, unfortunately.

### Markdown
Certainly I use Markdown a lot and after a few burns I settled with [plasticboy's plugin](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown).
It allows me to create new files by just adding a link `[topic](topic)` and then jump to it by typing `ge` while the cursor is on the link.
This opens the markdwown file and I am ready to go. Very convenient, even no need for the `.md`-suffix in the link
specification.

Hmmm, one **has** to leave the suffix out in order to work. Ok, just a little thing to remember, right? No problem.

### URI Handling
I used vim's builtin *netrw* to open files via the `gx`-mapping. Again, add a link `[topic](file.ext)`
and *netrw* uses the OS's native `open` command to handle the file link. This means it can handle URLs, file paths, Microsoft
Office Documents, etc...

A true productivity booster which mimics the behavior of just double-clicking a file in a GUI
file-manager. Only, this time one **must not** miss the the suffix in the filename.

There should be only ONE way to do things.


### All in One
I am only aware of one plugin which tries to be feature complete: [mdnav][mdnav].
Unfortunattely this project is not maintained any more, so I forked it and started to integrate it with
a CLI bookmark manager.


## How ?

### Simple user interface
Position cursor anywhere on URI and just say `go`.

    go (open URL, directories, files, ...)

<br/>
Paste links with human-readable link description instead of machine URL text:

    <leader>vl (paste link)

### Optional: Bookmark Manager Integration
Save URI in bookmark manager: [twbm](https://github.com/sysid/twbm).

    goo (open and save to bookmark DB)

<br/>
To remove an URI from the bookmark database the `dd` VIM command has been hooked into, so that whenever an URI
gets `dd`-ed, it also gets deleted from the bookmark database.

    dd (delete URI containing line from markdown and DB)


## Summary
This plugin hanles all URI use-cases in VIM text files transparently as you would expect it from your OS UI. No need to
memorize several key shortcuts or commands. An additional benefit is the bookmark manager integration, which allow to
open your URIs from the command line. A true productivity booster.
